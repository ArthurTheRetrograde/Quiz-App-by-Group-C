AUTHORS: Francine Carreon, Camille Cantero, Juliana Dacera, Ikr Celda, Ravin Chavez (10-Joule)

ðŸ’»âš’ Nowadays, logging in is one of the capabilities most applications have. The user are required to login to access the system. Most of the login programs limit the users to log on for a number of times, normally only three times. This kind of program uses repetitive structures to manage this procedure. Programmers might have used any of the looping commands such as for, while, and do-while. âš’ðŸ’»

PLEASE REMEMBER THAT:
- Ask the authors to get the credentials to gain access;
- You only get three (3) tries to enter credentials (in other words, username and password);
- For security reasons, if you got either username or password wrong, the program will not reveal or point out your mistake in log-in page;
- Permaban (Permanent Banning) mechanic is still under construction;
- Answers Keys will not be provided unless you ask for the password and instructions;
- Questions are strict and you need to enter what was asked for the program to work;
- After downloading, this will be automatically turned into a .zip file;
- You need an online (https://bit.ly/3HMiJbd) or offline (https://bit.ly/35STIhi) compiler to run the "Quiz App by Group C.sln";
- Finally, have fun!
